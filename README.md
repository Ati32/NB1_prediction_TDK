# Predicting the results of Hungarian football matches with machine learning

Github repo for our work which got us 1st place at the Students' Scientific Conference at BME in the PE section, and 2nd place at the 35th National Students' Scientific Conference (OTDK).

**Contributors:** Pintér József, Ragács Attila, Molontay Roland

**Goal:** Building machine learnign models on individual match data to predict future statistics. Based on these predictions, generate expected goals and final results while also taking into account the recent form of teams. Finally, using this system develop a profitable betting strategy.

**Files:**

- **Adatgyujtes_Eredemenyekcom.ipynb:** we got our data from the public domain Eredmenyek.com by webscraping, which can be found in this notebook
- **ML_algoritmusok_futtatva.ipynb:** training and testing of the ML algorithms to predict the statistics
- **ML_modell_fogadas-mukodo.ipynb:** applying the models for betting and developing the strategy
- **TDK_abstract_english.pdf:** short description of the project in English
- **Magyar_bajnoki_labdarugo_merkozesek_PJ_RA_vegleges.pdf:** full documentation in Hungarian
