# Predicting the results of Hungarian football matches with machine learning

**Contributors:** Pintér József, Ragács Attila, Molontay Roland

**Goal:** Building machine learnign models on individual match data to predict future statistics. Based on these predictions, generate expected goals and final results while also taking into account the recent form of teams. Finally, using this system develop a profitable betting strategy.
